# python-api-challenge
Resources:

https://apidocs.geoapify.com/ was used for API key and was used for codes for the places, locations, and hotel information for my homework assignment 
https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys was used for API key as well for the codes
I used AskBCS learning assist to help me break down some of my non functioning codes and assisted me in using different alternatives as a code 
I used stackoverflow to help me create my plots and graphs 
Mark, our TA also helped me get started on the homework assigmemnt with codes I did not initially have. 
I also wanted to add that my plots were not displaying for the Vacationpy homework. I did ask for assistance with AskBsc but they couldnt help me with it and had told me to let you know that the plots are not compatible with the latest version of jupyter notebooks.
